          <p>Hi. My name is Iman Hakedin. My student number is s3782317. My School email address is s3782317@student.rmit.edu.au. I'm from the country Eritrea in eastern Africa although I was born in Melbourne, Australia. I've completed Year 12 and in my first year at RMIT. I speak English and a little bit of Tigrinya (Primary Langauge spoken in Eritrea.

          <img src="images/Images/Personality Test 1.png" width="215" height="100" alt="">
          <p>I guess this diagnosis would be fairly accurate, something that should be known is that I feel my mood towards people and the world is definitely flexible. It changes so often but most of the time I do try to see the  best in people, and so this diagnosis fits pretty well.</p>

          <img src="images/Images/Personality Test 2.png" width="215" height="100" alt="">
          <p>This personality diagnosis I feel is more accurate to me than the first test because, most everything described is true. The fact that I am more introverted than outroverted is very true, also the fact that I prefer Intuition over sensing is quite accurate.</p>

           <img src="images/Images/Personality Test 3.png" width="215" height="100" alt="">
          <p>This diagnosis I feel is very accurate maybe even the most accurate. It states that I am a physical learner over reading or listening which is exactly how I feel when learning, also being a pianist and preferring learning physically then reading/listening is precise to me.</p>

              <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
              <p>My Interest in IT mainly lies in Developing programs for big business’, whether that be building websites for business’, Applications, even developing games for game Publishers (Activision, EA) My interest in IT never really had a starting point, it was built over the years slowly. I was introduced to computers an early age and since then seeing all the things that computers can do has really blown my mind. Seeing all the things that big tech companies like Google and Apple have been able to achieve is spectacular, they’ve truly revolutionised the world as we know it. I don’t really have to much experience with IT, I just know basic functions of the computer, I consider myself Technology literate. I chose RMIT mainly because of its well-deserved status of being a school with such an outstanding Technology department, it has computers in almost every classroom making it very convenient for technology students. It also is in the heart of Melbourne making the journey to it, not too far away. I am able to go to class, spend a couple hours after class to study and then ill be able to get home at an ideal time. I honestly don’t know what to expect with IT but I imagine that Ill learn to create programs, websites etc. I also expect to learn more about what IT is all about, things such as designing program interface and looking at what users want in products/services. </p>

              <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
              <p>My Ideal job would be that of a business analyst. A business analyst is someone who analyses operations related to technical systems within business, as well as learning the needs of stakeholders. I like this job because it seems like it involves a lot of managing which I do find interesting. It also enables me to also learn more about what stakeholders such as consumers want. I think this is particularly good because, I would enjoy being able to switch between working in an office alone to working alongside fellow employees. The requirements for a job like this is at least 5 years of work in IT prior to this role. Demonstrated skills of working in an open environment. Excellent demonstrated skills as a systems analyst working on complex software applications. great written and oral communications skills with the proven ability to author complex specifications. I think the only way I can obtain this job is by working hard in my years as just an Information Technologist. I will observe my managers or others in a position like that and use that to further my chances of acquiring the job. Also just furthering my skills in the workplace as best as I can. Also networking and using that to ask if any positions like that are available.</p>

              <h2>Project</h2>
              <p>
I’ve decided that I want to take part in making a video game. I have ideas of different types of video games for the longest time, games nowadays are getting very familiar and so I want to create a new type of game that is fun as well as new. My game would be simple in mechanics, like other First-person shooter games, it would involve typical guns and other similar things related to war-type games. It would be something that people would make friends call each other to ask when they are going to hop on and play because it would be a multiplayer game.

-Motivation:
My motivation for creating a game is because I have been playing games for a fairly long time, I know what goes into making a game, level creation, game design and Seeing things like this over the years has inspired me to start doing it by myself. There are some major game developers that have been able to create extraordinary games such as Elder Scrolls V Skyrim, Minecraft, GTA and Assassins Creed etc, has really inspired me to create my own games by letting my imagination take over.

-Description: 
So firstly, my game would be a Transformers based game, its objective would be very simple and like that of a deathmatch game mode. It would one team who would be the Military. They would be equipped with basic weaponry such as rifles and tanks. And there most likely would be a higher number of players than the other team. The other team would consist of the actual Transformers, they would look like how they look like in the Michael Bay movies. They would be able to transform into regular vehicles and move in that form and they would be equipped with the appropriate weapons. The aim of the game would be for one team to obtain more kills from the other team within the time frame. The match would start out slow with their being a grace period of half a minute to a minute. Then the match would begin and both teams would actively search for each other to kill each other. There most likely would be more game modes if the game was successful such as a survival mode where humans would have to outlast waves of transformers that would increase in amount every round or vice versa where transformers would have to outlast waves of humans that would increase in difficulty every round. Maybe even introducing a storyline mode where there is a plot to play through as either humans or transformers. But due to the rise of multiplayer games without story lines being sold for full price, we will stick with just multiplayer mode.

-Tools and technologies:
For a game like this where the graphics are expected to be above average, a great amount of time would have to be spent creating different maps, and sprites of the actual characters and guns as well. Also, with a game that transcends basic everyday life, a lot of time would be spent into coding the different abilities of the transformers, they way they move, their transformation and the animation as well as the military. Them being able to jump into vehicles and use them. Also, a license from Hasbro would be needed to make money off the game.

-Skills required:
A great deal of knowledge on creating games on engines such as unity or unreal engines would be required to create a game like this. Many lines of code would also need to be written because od the many different things that you can do in the game. High grade hardware such as strong GPUs and CPUs would be needed to run the game smoothly and with goo graphics. Nothing below intel i5 would be ideal for the game to run smoothly.

-Outcome: 
If this game is successful it may be used to inspire others into making games worth their money. Games that are new and original and that are also fun to play on. My original problem is that games are becoming very similar nowadays and with a game like this where a whole completely new mechanic is brought to and old brand, it shows that being original is what all game developers should try to achieve, also exploring different types of games may also be worthwhile.
